The prompt is to design, test and document a program that takes a set of inputs and produces an estimate of the usable fuel in the tank with an estimate of the associated uncertainties.

Given inputs: 
- Total fuel tank capacity 182 liters
- Digital fuel sensor has an error approximated as following a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 20 liters.
- Your fuel sensor reading is 34 liters
- Your airplane requires 18 liters per hour (approximated as uncertain with a Gaussian standard deviation of 2 liters per hour). Adopt estimates of fuel level and fuel consumption that are uncorrelated
